# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Network Settings
# These settings provide fine-grained control over the network behavior and packet handling within the server application.
# Adjusting these parameters can help optimize network performance and ensure secure communication between the server and clients.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General Network Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Shutdown Wait Time
# Defines the time in seconds the server waits for send/receive packets to be finalized during shutdown.
# Default: 5 seconds
ShutdownWaitTime = 5

# Define if packet dropping is enabled.
# Default: True
DropPackets = True

# Packet Dropping Threshold
# Defines the threshold to drop disposable packets. Higher values allow more packets to be queued
# before dropping starts, potentially reducing packet loss at the cost of higher memory usage.
# Default: 250
DropPacketThreshold = 2500

# Fairness Buckets
# The number of buckets used in the fairness controller, which maintains thread fairness among clients.
# Increasing this value may improve fairness in high concurrency environments.
# Default: 1
FairnessBuckets = 1

# Define if the auto reading should be enabled.
# If the auto reading is enabled the server will read the client's packet automatically.
# Otherwise the server needs to call the Client#read() when the client packet should be read.
# Default = True
AutoReading = True


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ThreadPool Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ThreadPool Size
# Defines the number of threads in the ThreadPool for network operations.
# Use values between 1 and 999 for a fixed thread pool. Any other value defaults to a cached thread pool.
# Default: 24
ThreadPoolSize = 24

# Buffer Segment Size
# Size of segments for dynamic buffers, which are used to increase buffer sizes as needed.
# Default: 64
BufferSegmentSize = 64

# Use Cached Thread Pool (true/false)
# Determines the type of thread pool used for handling network requests.
# - 'true' enables a cached thread pool, which dynamically creates threads as needed and reuses them when they become idle.
#   This is suitable for applications with fluctuating demand, allowing efficient handling of varying workloads.
# - 'false' uses a fixed thread pool with a set number of threads (defined by ThreadPoolSize).
#   This is more suitable for applications with a consistent workload where maintaining a fixed number of threads can ensure resource control.
# Default: false
UseCachedThreadPool = false

# Max Cached Threads
# Specifies the maximum number of threads allowed in the cached thread pool.
# This setting is only relevant if UseCachedThreadPool is set to 'true'.
# It limits the number of threads that can be created in the pool, preventing excessive resource use under high demand.
# A high number allows more flexibility in handling a large number of concurrent tasks but at the risk of higher resource consumption.
# Default: 2147483647 (effectively unlimited)
MaxCachedThreads = 2147483647


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Buffer Pool Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initial factor, size, and buffer size for small, medium, and large buffer pools.
# These pools optimize memory usage by reusing common buffer sizes.

# Initial Factor
# Multiplier for pre-initializing buffer pools. A higher factor means more buffers are pre-created.
# Default: 0 (no pre-initialization)
BufferPool.InitFactor = 0

# Small Buffer Pool
# Size and buffer size for small buffers. Used for common, smaller network packets.
# Default: 100 buffers of 128 bytes each
BufferPool.Small.Size = 100
BufferPool.Small.BufferSize = 128

# Medium Buffer Pool
# Size and buffer size for medium buffers. Used for standard network packets.
# Default: 50 buffers of 2048 bytes each
BufferPool.Medium.Size = 50
BufferPool.Medium.BufferSize = 2048

# Large Buffer Pool
# Size and buffer size for large buffers. Used for large or infrequent network packets.
# Default: 25 buffers of 24576 bytes each
BufferPool.Large.Size = 25
BufferPool.Large.BufferSize = 24576
